This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#This version is old and no longer in use by GalaxyX. Archive soon-

## Quick Start

1. Configure your React app in the Auth0 Dashboard as outlined in the course.

2. Create a .env file in the project root (same directory as package.json) that contains the following:

```
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-f664gi-n.us.auth0.com
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=pJeeFpD9kQZ6TNiq7ZTJhYnsgrdoFX1C
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

3. Run the following:

```
npm install
npm start
```
